# GPT-based Chatbot

## Introduction
This project is a terminal-based chatbot, exclusively operated through command-line interactions. It harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT models to facilitate a text-based conversational AI experience. Designed to run locally, this chatbot utilizes OpenAI's language models to comprehend and respond to user inputs in a terminal environment.

## Features
- Terminal chatbot
- Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 (or specify your model).
- Easy to use and integrate.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Access to OpenAI's API (API key required).

## Setup
To set up the chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
Run: git clone https://github.com/pythoniszen/gpt-api-chatbot.git


2. **Install Dependencies:**
Run: pip install openai

3. **API Key Configuration:**
Place your open ai api key generated from openai in the main.py file. The
key should be placed in line 3 in between the "" where it says "your-api-key".

## Usage
To start the chatbot, run: python3 chatbot.py while in the project directory.
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatbot.

Respond with "quit" to the chatbot to close the program.
